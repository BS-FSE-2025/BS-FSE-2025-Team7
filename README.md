Project Title:
voice bridge 
The VoiceBridge website is a digital platform designed to enhance communication between citizens and local authorities, making the process of reporting infrastructure issues simpler, faster, and more efficient. Through the website, residents can report problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, or environmental hazards, and track their resolution in real time. Local authorities receive the reports instantly, prioritize them based on urgency, and address them in an organized manner. The platform improves urban quality of life by enabling swift resolution of infrastructure issues, fostering transparency, and building trust between residents and authorities. It is an essential tool in the era of smart cities, where technology is used to make urban living better.Getting Started
